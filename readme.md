## Engel Framework

Develop small Framework is to share my progress in PHP, MVC architecture and Unit Testing .

## Install

1 . Database import

		Required:

			User : root
			Password: 123
			Database: project_pizzaria

		In Terminal you type :

			mysql -u root -p123 project_pizzaria < database.sql

2. I think you know what to do ( rs )

		For you view All users type "?ver" in URL
			Example:

				http://localhost/engel_framework/?ver

		For you create NEW Client, type "?criar" in URL
			Example:

				http://localhost/engel_framework/?criar
